# Password-Generator

## Description
As a full stack developer with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

# Usage
To use this application to obtain a new and secure password, click the button to generate a password.  You will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.  When prompted for password criteria, select which criteria to include in the password.  When prompted for the length of the password, choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.  When asked for character types to include in the password, confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  After you answer each prompt, your input will be validated and at least one character type should be selected.  When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.  The password will then be displayed on the page.
